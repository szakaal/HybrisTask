# HybrisTask

Application created for the requirement process to Hybris.

To run application type in command prompt:

node start.js <path> <port>

For example:

node start.js /images 3000 (these are the default values aswell)

This is my first nodeJS application, first app with elements of ES6 and first app using git repositories.
